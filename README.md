# User Manager

This repository contains a simple demo API built with NodeJS.
The API is used to manage users in a MongoDB database.

### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).
The application and database are setup on different nodes(containers) to communicate using Docker Toolbox.

### Installation
* Start up your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows OS).
* Ensure that you've `Docker Toolbar` installed on your PC. Run 'docker -v' and 'docker-compose -v' to confirm installation.
* Clone the repository by entering the command 'git clone https://github.com/raphael-ekete/UserManager' in the terminal.
* Navigate to the project folder using `cd UserManager` on your terminal (or command prompt)
* After cloning, run the applications with the command `docker-compose up --build`.
* To access the app, go to 'http://localhost:3000' or 'http://<docker-assigned-ip-address>:3000'
* To access the database, go to 'mongodb://mongodatabase:27017'
